# Designing_Controller_for_Hard_disk_DC_motor
A hard disk is a data storage device. It uses magnetic storage system along with electronic hardware to access the data. The electronic circuit consists of a dc motor. The dc motor state space has been given. In this project, I'll be finding the stability of the state space, designing a controller, and analyzing the motor. 


## This is a project that I was given by my Control System's Professor, Dr. Salman Ahmad.
